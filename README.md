# mockserver

A simple mockserver implementation in Dart using Aqueduct, Postgres, Docker

## overview

_Purpose:_ request an external service `https://www.externalservice.com/` from own development application with a relative path `hello/world/15`, but don't spend money in development environment on requesting external services, just need to request mocked data.

_Necessity:_ Resolve some relative endpoint `hello/world/15` to a local server and add these on the go. This implementation: resolves to `http://localhost:9999/mock?name=`+`hello/world/15` instead of `https://www.externalservice.com/`+`hello/world/15`

_Solution:_ clone this repo, ensure you have a running postgres instance, run mockserver, replace the external service with mockserver in env, e.g.`http://localhost:9999/mock?name=` and send in the current POST. 

_Expected:_ When requesting `<env.var>/hello/world/15` will then return the json content of the response field from the mockserver instead of the external service. 

_Note1:_ postgres is set up to connect to localhost using `host.docker.internal` (change this to `localhost` when running without docker locally) which only works on mac. Replace with another postgres docker container or a postgres host running on a server or  google for alternative solutions. 


_Note2:_  go to channel.dart and change the postgres connection info (user, pass, db name) to match what you have created for your locally running postgres db.
